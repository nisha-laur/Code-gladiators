**<h1>SmartSpend</h1>**
#### Do you find it hard to keep track of all records of Bills. How much did I spend on food/stationery/registration today ? What amount did my parents send me this month ? How much am I left with ? Would saving money even help me in buying that phone?
#### Proposed Solution
