**<h1>SmartSpend</h1>**
#### Do you find it hard to keep track of all records of Bills. How much did I spend on food/stationery/registration today ? What amount did my parents send me this month ? How much am I left with ? Would saving money even help me in buying that phone?
#### Proposed Solution
**1. Income and Expense Tracking**



* The application will allow users to add income and expense transactions with details such as date, category, description, and amount.

* Users can easily input and categorize their financial activities in a few clicks.


**2. Reports and Analytics**

* The application will generate reports and provide visual analytics, such as charts and graphs, to help users understand their financial patterns, identify trends, and make informed decisions.

**3. Reminders and Notifications**
* Users will receive reminders and notifications for upcoming bill payments, budget limits, or goal milestones. 

* This feature will help users stay on track and avoid missing important financial obligations.


**4. Goal Setting and Tracking**

* Users will be able to set financial goals, such as saving a certain amount or paying off debt. 

* The application will track progress towards these goals, providing reminders and visual representations of achievements.

**5. Transaction Management**

* Users can edit or delete existing transactions if they need to make corrections or remove entries. This provides flexibility and accuracy in maintaining financial records.

 **6. Budgeting and Categories:**

* The solution will include a budgeting feature where users can set spending limits for different expense categories.
